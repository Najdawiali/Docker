# Docker
This project encapsulates the creation and deployment of a Dockerized dictionary server, initially developed in Project 1.
I have refined the server's functionality and introduced a new `client.py` that interacts seamlessly with our `server.py`.
The Docker containerization ensures a consistent and isolated environment, making deployment straightforward and reliable.
